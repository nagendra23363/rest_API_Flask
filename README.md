# Flask REST API – User Management

A simple REST API built with **Flask** to demonstrate CRUD operations  
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user data stored in memory.

- **GET /users** – Retrieve all users
- **GET /users/<id>** – Retrieve a specific user
- **POST /users** – Create a new user
- **PUT /users/<id>** – Update an existing user
- **DELETE /users/<id>** – Delete a user
